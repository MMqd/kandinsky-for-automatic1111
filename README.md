### Image Mixing
Combine images and/or prompts together. Can be used for style transfer, and combining a background with a subject.

## How To Use
1. Select "Kandinsky" in the scripts section
2. Set "Prior Inference Steps". Increasing the value improves the results, but it reaches a plateau at around 128. Beyond that, the image may change, but the quality remains consistent.

### Image Mixing
#### Prompt + Image
1. In text2img set the prompt
2. In the extra image field in the script section, set the image
3. Set the "Interpolate Image 1 Strength" to the desired amount of image generated by the prompt
4. Set the "Interpolate Image 2 Strength" to the desired amount of image in the script section

#### Image + Image
1. In img2img set an image
2. In the extra image field in the script section, set the image
3. Set the "Interpolate Image 1 Strength" to the desired amount of image generated by the prompt
4. Set the "Interpolate Image 2 Strength" to the desired amount of image in the script section

## Notes
* Prompt size is 512 tokens
* Seeds are somewhat consistent across different resolutions
* Changing sampling steps keeps the same image, while changing quality
* The seed is not as important as the prompt, the subjects/compositions across seeds are very similar
* It is very easy to "overcook" images with prompts, if this happens remove keywords or reduce CFG scale
    * Negative prompts aren't needed, so "low quality, bad quality..." can be ommited
    * Short positive prompts are good, too many keywords confuse the ai

## Features
* Text to image
* Batching
* Img2img
* Inpainting
* Image mixing
* vram optimizations (16 bit float and attention slicing)

## Supported Settings
* prompt
* negative prompt
* cfg scale
* seed
* width
* height
* sampling steps
* denoising strength
* batch count
* batch size (only first image's seed can be replicated)
* img2img image, and inpaint
* inpaint at full resolution (needs fixing)

Any other setting such as seed variations, will have no effect on generated images.

## Known Bugs
* Ram memory leak (still investigating)

## Limitations
* Uses the Hugging Face image generation pipeline to run Kandinsky (Only "kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-1" is supported on Hugging Face, so no custom models)
* No controlnet
* No training
* No support for other extensions like ultimate-upscale, tiled diffusion, etc.
* No progress bar in GUI
* No choice for samplers
* Stable diffusion model and vae are not unloaded from ram, resulting in ~15gb ram usage
* Not possible to replicate seed in batches
* Strength of words in the prompt can't be set
* Other automatic1111 features such as seed variations, hires fix, tiling, etc. are not supported
* Can't be run with other automatic1111 scripts
